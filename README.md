You have two points (x, y) and (x1, y1) --> you start from point (x,y) -- Assume that both the points are in the positive quadrant.
and (x, y) is less than or equal to (x1, y1)
Now, the navigation from the (x, y) point is going to be like this --> from the current point, you can navigate to (x+y, y) or (x, x+y)
